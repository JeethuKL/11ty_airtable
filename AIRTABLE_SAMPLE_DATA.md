## üîß Quick Setup Instructions

1. **Create your Airtable base** with three tables: `Speakers`, `Sessions`, and `Posts`
2. **Add the fields** as specified above for each table
3. **Copy the sample data** into each table
4. **Set up the link** between Sessions and Speakers tables
5. **Update your .env file** with the correct Airtable API key and Base ID
6. **Run the sync** with `npm run sync`

## üîó Field Relationships

- **Sessions ‚Üí Speakers**: Each session can link to one speaker
- **Posts**: Independent table for blog content
- **Multiple select fields**: Add options as you enter data (Airtable will create them automatically)

## üìù Notes

- **Images**: The image paths in this sample data are placeholder paths. You can either:
  - Add actual images to your `src/images/` folder with these names
  - Update the image paths to point to actual images
  - Leave them as placeholders (the site will show default gradients)
  
- **Dates**: All dates are set for October 2024. Update them to your actual conference dates.

- **Capacity and Duration**: Numbers are in standard units (people for capacity, minutes for duration).

Once you add this data to Airtable and run `npm run sync`, your speakers section will be fully populated!
